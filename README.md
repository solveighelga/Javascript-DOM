# Javascript-DOM
## I decided to make a Grocery List
### The animations is in h1, when you reload the page the lext fades onto the screen. This was made possible with both my js file and css.
### My used eventListener to write what I need to buy at the store, click ENTER and it moved below. Also to mark task finished you can click the item and it will draw a line through it. If this was a mistake click the item again and the line will dissapear. The pencil icon is a BUTTON that acts makes everything from the list be cleared.
## For more details look at comments in main.js file :)
